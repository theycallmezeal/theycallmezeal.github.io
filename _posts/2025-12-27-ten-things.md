I once saw a kooky old professor website with a page full of lists of ten things. I never found it again, but in tribute to that, here are some lists of ten things.

### Ten really hard things about Japanese after I've been learning it for over a decade

1. Never being *quite* sure when pronouns are clear from context
2. の or な? (Need to memorize for each word)
3. The sheer volume of vocabulary; anecdotally it feels like way more words are in common use
4. Pitch accent, "lol guess" edition
5. Being terrified of using the wrong formality level. If I ever hit the wrong person with だ I would feel like I just flipped them the bird
6. が instead of を with potential verbs
7. Never being quite sure what ている means
8. そう？　でしょう？　らしい？ The other そう？
9. This is a weird one, but I'm too used to ending things in connectives like が、けど、から、んですが and the like that it's really hard to end on a ます without autopiloting into something that sounds like I have more to say
10. Never knowing how much of an accent to say English words in

### Ten really hard things about German after I've been learning it for over a decade

1. drucken vs. drücken
2. der Druck, die Drucke vs. der Druck, die Drücke
3. der Teil vs. das Teil; bonus points for all the compounds
4. Konjunktiv I (who even uses this?)
5. die Punkte, which I always think is die Pünkte
6. The fact that only feminine measurements pluralize (20 Euro, but 20 Minute**n**)
7. Subordinated auxiliaries go *before* Doppelinfinitiv (zB dass ich das *habe* machen können)
8. Fudging my way through inventing a compound noun on the fly
9. When to use "anticipatory es"
10. Using the appropriate gender for inanimate "it" - I will **proudly** use *es* every single time

### Ten math facts that are hard for me to remember

1. 7 x 9 = 63

7. 9 x 6 = 54
8. 9 + 4 = 13
9. 7 x 12, 8 x 12, and 9 x 12 - literally useless
10. 6 x 4, 8 x 4, and 6 x 8, which all feel like they equal 32

### Ten meaningful songs to me

1. **[Dirty Little Secret - All American Rejects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKERDtbpeHc)**, the first song I remember liking
2. **[No Limit - 2 Unlimited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTCw8CtX0E)**, which kickstarted a lifelong love of 90's-present EDM
3. **[Marry the Night - Lady Gaga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4IgYxHEAuk&pp=ygUPbWFycnkgdGhlIG5pZ2h0)**, which taught me to appreciate the power of pop music

5. **[The Spiritual - Jukebox the Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vfI0aCCHug)**, a college acapella group's performance of which taught me the power of live performance

10. **[Little Bird - Annie Lennox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMq-uIj1cKI)**, which perfectly captures the mix of anxiety and optimism I feel at time of writing, three weeks before starting grad school

### Ten things I'll never wear

1. **Vests.**
2. **Bow ties.**
3. **Tank tops.**
4. **Suspenders.**
5. **A blue suit.**
6. **Pants in unusual colors**.
7. **Boots,** except in the rain.
8. Anything **tucked into jeans.** I honestly don't even wear jeans that much any more; chinos FTW.
9. **Shirts in unusual patterns** - only plaid (my favorite) and rarely vertical stripes. I have some absolutely [bonkers plaid](../images/bonkers-plaid.jpg), but it's still plaid.
10. **Loafers, wingtips, and other eye-catching footwear.** I like leather shoes, but only plain or cap toe oxfords or derbies that are darker than my pants. Casual shoes follow the same rule, so no white sneakers. I have a pair of derbies that have a light-colored welt, and that's as far as I'll go.
