I once saw a kooky old professor website with a page full of lists of ten things. I never found it again, but in tribute to that, here are some lists of ten things.

<section class="lists" markdown=1>

<div class="list purple" markdown=1>
### Ten things I'll never wear

1. **Vests.**
2. **Bow ties.**
3. **Tank tops.**
4. **Suspenders.**
5. **A navy blue suit.**
6. **Pants in unusual colors**.
7. **Boots,** except in the rain.
8. Anything **tucked into jeans.**
9. **Shirts in unusual patterns** - only plaid (my favorite) and rarely vertical stripes. I have some absolutely [bonkers plaid](../images/bonkers-plaid.jpg), but it's still plaid.
10. **Loafers, wingtips, and other eye-catching footwear.** I like leather shoes, but only plain or cap toe oxfords or derbies that are darker than my pants. I have a pair of derbies that have a light-colored welt, and that's as far as I'll go.
</div>

<div class="list yellow" markdown=1>

### Ten math facts that are hard for me to remember

1. 7 x 9 = 63
2. 4 + 7 = 11
3. 16 - 9 = 7
4. 8 x 7 = 56
5. 3 x 6 = 18
6. 15 - 9 = 6
7. 9 x 6 = 54
8. 9 + 4 = 13
9. 7 x 12, 8 x 12, and 9 x 12 - literally useless
10. 6 x 4, 8 x 4, and 6 x 8, which all feel like they equal 32

</div>

<div class="list red" markdown=1>

### Ten languages I earnestly started learning but stopped before I got anywhere, ranked by how far I got

1. Levantine Arabic
2. Russian
3. Polish
4. American Sign Language
5. Korean
6. Norwegian
7. Italian
8. Welsh
9. Cantonese
10. Latin

</div>

### Ten most aesthetically pleasing IPA symbols

1. ɮ
2. ɱ
3. ɕ
4. ʘ
5. ɰ
6. ɤ
7. ʒ

<div class="list green" markdown=1>

### Ten things I've never done that I think I could nail on the first try

1. **Tap dance.**
2. **News anchoring.**
3. **Scamming** and/or **grifting.**
4. Operating a **lighthouse.**
5. An hour-long **DJ set.**
6. A **croquembouche** from scratch.
7. Sewing a **mascot costume**.
8. **Growing all my own food**, with the exception of rice.
9. **Makeup**, like putting an entire bridal party in full wedding glam.
10. The experiment where you use **dish soap to extract strawberry DNA.**
