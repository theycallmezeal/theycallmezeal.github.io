I once saw a kooky old professor website with a page full of lists of ten things. I never found it again, but in tribute to that, here are some lists of ten things.

### Ten math facts that are hard for me to remember

1. 7 x 9 = 63
2. 4 + 7 = 11
3. 16 - 9 = 7
4. 8 x 7 = 56
5. 3 x 6 = 18
6. 15 - 9 = 6
7. 9 x 6 = 54
8. 9 + 4 = 13
9. 7 x 12, 8 x 12, and 9 x 12 - literally useless
10. 6 x 4, 8 x 4, and 6 x 8, which all feel like they equal 32

### Ten meaningful songs to me

1. **[Dirty Little Secret - All American Rejects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKERDtbpeHc)**, the first song I remember liking
2. **[No Limit - 2 Unlimited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTCw8CtX0E)**, which kickstarted a lifelong love of 90's-present EDM
3. **[Marry the Night - Lady Gaga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4IgYxHEAuk&pp=ygUPbWFycnkgdGhlIG5pZ2h0)**, which taught me to appreciate the power of pop music
4. **[Life Itself - Glass Animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lUfunQW84U)**, which I listened to countless times in the car with my best friend from college
5. **[The Spiritual - Jukebox the Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vfI0aCCHug)**, a college acapella group's performance of which taught me the power of live performance
6. **[Baby Come Back - Player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjBs4pKwzhU)**, which irreversibly converted me into a shameless yacht rocker
7. **[July - Noah Cyrus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBeXKby2tmM)**, which almost perfectly tells the story of the worst month of my life
8. **[Reelin' in the Years - Steely Dan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91XTZ92zs2w)**, which, in one of the intense moments I've ever experienced, provided me with a brief escape from the worst month of my life
9. **[My Day Will Come - James Francies ft. Yebba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTqREEyijSA)**, which I listened to incessantly as I recovered from the worst month of my life
10. **[Little Bird - Annie Lennox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMq-uIj1cKI)**, which perfectly captures the mix of anxiety and optimism I feel at time of writing, three weeks before starting grad school

### Ten things I'll never wear

1. **Vests.**
2. **Bow ties.**
3. **Tank tops.**
4. **Suspenders.**
5. **A blue suit.**
6. **Pants in unusual colors**.
7. **Boots,** except in the rain.
8. Anything **tucked into jeans.**
9. **Shirts in unusual patterns** - only plaid (my favorite) and rarely vertical stripes. I have some absolutely [bonkers plaid](../images/bonkers-plaid.jpg), but it's still plaid.
10. **Loafers, wingtips, and other eye-catching footwear.** I like leather shoes, but only plain or cap toe oxfords or derbies that are darker than my pants. Casual shoes follow the same rule, so no white sneakers. I have a pair of derbies that have a light-colored welt, and that's as far as I'll go.
