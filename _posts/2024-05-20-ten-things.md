I once saw a kooky old professor website with a page full of lists of ten things. I never found it again, but in tribute to that, here are some lists of ten things.

<section class="lists" markdown=1>

<div class="list purple" markdown=1>
### Ten things I'll never wear

1. **Vests**
2. **Bow ties.**
3. **Tank tops.**
4. **Suspenders.**
5. **A navy blue suit.**
6. **Pants in unusual colors**.
7. **Boots,** except in the rain.
8. Anything **tucked into jeans.**
9. **Shirts in unusual patterns** - only plaid (my favorite) and rarely vertical stripes. I have some absolutely [bonkers plaid](../images/bonkers-plaid.jpg), but it's still plaid.
10. **Loafers, wingtips, and other eye-catching footwear.** I like leather shoes, but only plain or cap toe oxfords or derbies that are darker than my pants. I have a pair of derbies that have a light-colored welt, and that's as far as I'll go.

5. An hour-long **DJ set.**
6. A **croquembouche** from scratch.
7. Sewing a **mascot costume**.
