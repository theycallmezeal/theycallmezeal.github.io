Here's a list of one thousand words and phrases chosen to be useful to a beginning learner.

### Usage notes

This work is licensed under a [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

When using this list to create vocabulary lists in other languages, many words will:

* have multiple translations
* translate into multiple words or even long phrases
* not translate easily or typically be left out of sentences
* translate into different parts of speech

This is expected and okay!

When considering a word in other languages, consider whether other words go with it, especially prepositions or particles and light verbs. For example, in English, the word 'wait' goes with the word 'for', but in German, it goes with the word meaning 'on'. In English, you use 'have' with the word 'breakfast', but in French, you use the word 'take', instead.

Words that are *not* included in the 1000 are:

* numerals
* personal, demonstrative, indefinite, and reflexive pronouns (I, you, they, this, that, one, myself, yourself...)
* names of languages, countries, and currencies

This list should also be adapted for cultural context: I'd expect different kinship terms, foods, conversational phrases, animals, and places, and there may be relevant topics that are not covered here.
