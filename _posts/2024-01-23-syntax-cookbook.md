title: Syntax cookbook
---

Here's a "cookbook" of various kinds of English syntax trees. This is my attempt at capturing a happy medium of what's commonly introduced in introductory texts and my own undergrad syntax class.

Perhaps the most controversial assumption is that morphology is a product of syntax. Not taking sides here - all I'm saying is this is what I was first taught.

# Terminology

<dl>
    <dt>Headedness principle</dt>
    <dd>A phrase needs a head; an XP needs an X.</dd>
    <dt>Binarity principle</dt>
    <dd>Everything has two children (which may![Alt text](image.png) be empty or host a combination of multiple things due to movement).</dd>
    <dt>Projection</dt>
    <dd>The presence of an X necessitates the presence of X' and XP above it.</dd>
    <dt><a name="vish">VISH</a> (Verb-Internal Subject Hypothesis)</dt>
    <dd>The hypothesis that subjects of verbs generate in SpecVP and raise to SpecTP.</dd>
    <dt><a name="hmc">Head-Movement Constraint</a></dt>
    <dd>Heads can only move to adjacent heads.</dd>
</dl>

# X-bar structure

![X-bar structure](/images/trees/xp.png)

You can have as many nested X' levels as you want. The specifier position of XP is abbreviated SpecXP.

# "Classic" DP

![Tree for a DP](/images/trees/dp.png)

# Possessed DP

![Tree for a possessed DP](/images/trees/possessed.png)

The "subject" generates in the specifier of a lexical phrase before raising to the specifier of a functional phrase, much like SpecVP raising to SpecTP per [VISH](#vish).

# SVO sentence

![Tree for an SVO sentence](/images/trees/svo.png)

The subject generates in SpecVP and raises to SpecTP as per [VISH](#vish). T lowers to V since [present] is not pronounceable on its own; âˆšeat+[present] resolves at a later stage to "eat".

# Modal

![Tree for a sentence with a modal](/images/trees/modal.png)

Things that can occupy T are features [past] [present] and modals.

# Question with a modal

![Tree for a question with a modal](/images/trees/question-modal.png)

Questions generate with a phonologically null [question] C that need to combine with something to be pronounced; here, the T raises to C.

# Question with do-support

![Tree for a question with do-support](/images/trees/question-do-support.png)

As in the question with a modal, T raises to C, but as the [question] C and [present] T are both unpronounced, the repair strategy is to resolve the combination to "do".

# Negation with do-support

![Tree for a question with negation and do-support](/images/trees/negation.png)

T-to-V movement, like in the "classic" SVO sentence, is blocked due to the [Head-Movement Constraint](#hmc). The repair strategy is to resolve the unpronounceable [present] to "do".

# Aspect be/have

![Tree for a sentence with aspectual be](/images/trees/aspect-be.png)

# Question with aspect be/have

![Tree for a question with aspectual be](/images/trees/aspect-question-be.png)
