My name is **Adam An**. My first name is **Adam** [ædəm] and my last name is **An** [æn] - it sounds like "Anne". I use he/him pronouns.

My *legal* first name is Zeal [zil] - or, if you have the [feel-fill merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_vowel_changes_before_historic_/l/#Fill%E2%80%93feel_merger) like I do, [zɪl]. Because of this, my personal username is *theycallmezeal* or *tcmzeal* on various places across the Internet.

Otherwise, I hardly use the name Zeal. I [publish as Adam An](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0002-9181-7539); please refer to me as **Adam**.

# Frequently asked questions

## Where did Zeal come from?

I truthfully have no idea.

## Why'd you start going by Adam?

Because I don't have to explain it to people! I got it from a little-known Cartoon Network show called [My Gym Partner's A Monkey](https://mygympartneramonkey.fandom.com/wiki/Adam_Lyon) when I was in second grade.

## Do you have a middle name?

Ryan. Legally I have no middle name, but if I ever change it, this is what I'm using. There's no significance to it, but I like that it ends in an A and a nasal. Other candidates were Ethan and Tristan, but let's be real, am I a Tristan?

## Do you have zeal?

I used to get this so much that this is why I don't use that name any more.
