My name is **Adam Ryan An**. My first name is **Adam** [ædəm], my middle name is **Ryan** [ɹaɪən] and my last name is **An** [æn] - it sounds like "Anne". I use he/him pronouns.

My *legal* first name is Zeal [zil] - or, if you have the [feel-fill merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_vowel_changes_before_historic_/l/#Fill%E2%80%93feel_merger) like I do, [zɪl]. I hardly use this name.

I [publish as Adam Ryan An](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9181-7539); please refer to me as **Adam**.

## Where did Zeal come from?

I truthfully have no idea.

## Why'd you start going by Adam?

Because I don't have to explain it to people! I got it from a little-known Cartoon Network show called [My Gym Partner's A Monkey](https://mygympartneramonkey.fandom.com/wiki/Adam_Lyon) when I was in second grade.

## What about the middle name?

I use it professionally since my last name makes it hard to find me online. There's no significance to it, but I like that it ends in an A and a nasal. Other candidates were Ethan and Tristan, but let's be real, am I a Tristan?

## Do you have zeal?

That question is why I don't use that name any more.
