I studied linguistics and computer science at the College of William & Mary.

# I like language

My linguistic interests are split between:

* psycholinguistics (specifically real-time language processing)
* morphology (and its interactions with phonology and syntax)
* historical (I'm most well-read about Proto-Indo-European)

Advised by [Dan Parker](http://cell.wm.edu/parker/), I researched how information is stored in and retrieved from memory during sentence comprehension using computational and behavioral methods.

I'm B1-ish ([CEFR scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages)) in Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and German. That's conversational but crunchy. I like to say I speak them like pie crust - the foundation is there, but it's flaky.

# I do computery stuff

I do software development. I lean web; within that I lean frontend. I like making websites usable, accessible, and neat-looking.

I actively use Vue for frontend; Django, Flask, or node.js for backend; and Jekyll for static site generation, like on this website.

# I am capable of other things

I do animation. In 3D I use Maya; in 2D you can't go wrong with After Effects and Premiere. [Portfolio](portfolio#video)

I like Just Dance a stupid lot, both as a source of visual inspiration and for, well, dancing. In 2017 I was the 16th best Just Dance player in the United States.

I like cooking. Here are some [recipes](https://www.cinc.kitchen/users/Adam) I've written.
